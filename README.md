# N3P6 by Moeru AI

## About

You may have already seen [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi).

This project is similar to AIRI with the following key differences:

- Focus on VRM / WebXR Experience
- Not interested in VTuber
- No attempts to connect to other games or software

### Naming

Ever heard of [Galatea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatea_(mythology))?

To avoid naming conflicts and make it unique,
we named it after the satellite of the same name, [Neptune VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatea_(moon)) (NEP6, E => 3).

## Development

git clone https://github.com/moeru-ai/n3p6.git
